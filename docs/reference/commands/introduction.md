# Introduction
draky is pretty robust when it comes to commands. It provides you with some built-in commands for managing your
environment, but also allows you to create your own custom commands that can be run inside or outside the
containers.

You can run `draky -h` and add `-h` to any command, to get help regarding the tree of available commands.
