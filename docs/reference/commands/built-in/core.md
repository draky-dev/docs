# core
This group of commands is related to the draky core image that is responsible for wiring everything up.

## start
Start the draky's core image. Most of the time it's unnecessary to use this command and the draky's core image starts
automatically after running any command, if it's not already started.

## destroy
Destroy the draky's core container (it will be recreated the next time the `draky` command will be run).
