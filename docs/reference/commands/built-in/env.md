# env
This group of commands is related to the project's environment.

## up
Start the environment. This command will spin the containers based on the `docker-compose.yml` file existing in the
environment's configuration. If the `docker-compose.recipe.yml` is present, the `docker-compose.yml` file will be
autogenerated first.

Available flags:

- `-s` Substitute the variables with their values in the resulting `docker-compose.yml` file.

- [docker-compose.recipe.yml](/docs/reference/docker-compose#recipe)

## stop
Freeze the environment. The data in the containers will be preserved. This is an equivalent to `docker compose stop`.

## down
Destroy the environment. All data, that was stored only in the containers, will be lost. This is an equivalent to
`docker compose down`. It's still fine to use it, provided that everything that needs to be preserved is stored on the
host by using volumes.

## build
This creates a `docker-compose.yml` file based on the `docker-compose.recipe.yml` file if the latter exists.

Available flags:

- `-s`: substitute the variables with their values in the resulting `docker-compose.yml` file.

## compose <...>
Allows interacting with `docker compose` directly. You can pass any arguments.

## debug
Group of commands used for the environment debugging.

### vars
Display all variables available in the environment.
