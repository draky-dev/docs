# About

## Introduction
Addons are external resources that help you prepare your environment. They can be as simple as few files that you may
find helpful to mount in some containers, or they can hook into the `docker-compose.yml` generation process, when using
a [recipe](/docs/reference/docker-compose#recipe) and modify some services themselves.

## Installation

To install an addon you only need to put its directory inside the `.draky/addons/` path in you project.
